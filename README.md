SYNAPSE App ðŸš—

An AI-powered vehicle control app prototype built using React Native and Expo. The app allows users to control vehicle functions like starting/stopping the engine, locking/unlocking the car, and viewing activities. Additionally, it shows traffic near the user's location and logs engine sessions dynamically with start time, end time, total duration, and distance traveled.

Prerequisites
- Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. [Download here](https://nodejs.org/).
- Expo CLI: Install the Expo CLI globally:
  npm install -g expo-cli
- Expo Go App: Install the Expo Go app on your smartphone (available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/)).

Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vehicle-control-app.git
   cd vehicle-control-app

2. Install dependencies:
   npm install

3. Start the development server:
   expo start

4. Run the app:
   - Open the Expo Go app on your smartphone.
   - Scan the QR code displayed in the terminal or browser.

Usage
1. Navigate to the Home Screen to:
   - Start/Stop the engine.
   - Lock/Unlock the car.
   - View traffic near your current location.
2. Navigate to the Activity Screen to view:
   - Engine session logs with:
     - Start and end time.
     - Total duration.
     - Distance traveled.

How It Works
1. Quick Actions:
   - Use startEngine and stopEngine functions in ActivitiesContext to log and manage engine sessions.
2. Traffic Map:
   - Fetches the user's location using expo-location.
   - Displays traffic with the react-native-maps library.
3. Activity Log:
   - Logs each engine session dynamically and displays the details on the Activity Screen.
